The following array is given:

    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])

Using the slice operator, transform this array into the following:

    array([[ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 0,  1,  2,  3]])

In response, print transformed array to the console.

Solution:

import numpy as np

A = np.arange(12).reshape(-1, 4)
print(A[::-1])
