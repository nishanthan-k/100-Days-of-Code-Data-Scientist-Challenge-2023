Using Numpy create a 6x6 two-dimensional array - identity matrix with int data type. Print this array to the console as shown below.

Tip: Use the np.eye() function.

Expected result:

[[1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1]]


Solution 1:

import numpy as np
print(np.eye(6, dtype=int))


Solution 2:

import numpy as np
print(np.eye(N=6, dtype='int'))
