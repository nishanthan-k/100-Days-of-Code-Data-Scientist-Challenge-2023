np.allclose()
    The allclose() function is used to returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.  
    
    The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.
    
    The relative difference (rtol * abs(b)) and the absolute difference atol are added together to compare against the absolute difference between a and b.
  
    If either array contains one or more NaNs, False is returned.
    Infs are treated as equal if they are in the same place and of the same sign in both arrays.
