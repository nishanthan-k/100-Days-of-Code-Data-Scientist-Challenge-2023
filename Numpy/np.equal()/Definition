Check if the following arrays are equal (element-wise):

A = np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.3])
B = np.array([0.3999999999, 0.5000000001, 0.3])


Use the comparison operator == in this exercise and print the result to the console.

Expected result:

[False False  True]


Solution 1:

print(A == B)

Solution 2:
print(np.equal(A, B))
