Exercise 1

The following array is given:
  
  A = np.array([[1, 4, 3],
                [5, 2, 6]])

Iterate through this array and print each element to the console.

Tip: Use the np.nditer() function.

Expected result:

    1
    4
    3
    5
    2
    6

Solution:

import numpy as np 

A = np.array([[1, 4, 3],
              [5, 2, 6]])
                  
for i in np.nditer(A):
    print(i)
