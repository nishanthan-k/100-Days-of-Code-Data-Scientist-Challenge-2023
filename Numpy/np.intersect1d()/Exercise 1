The following arrays are given:

A = np.arange(8).reshape(-1, 4)
B = np.array([[9, 10, 11, 3],
              [2, 8, 0, 9]])      

Extract the same elements (intersection) of the arrays as a list and print result to the console.

Tip: Use the np.intersect1d() function.

Expected result:

    [0 2 3]


Solution:

import numpy as np

A = np.arange(8).reshape(-1, 4)
B = np.array([[9, 10, 11, 3],
              [2, 8, 0, 9]])     
              
print(np.intersect1d(A, B))
