The following arrays are given:

A = np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9])
B = np.array([0.38, 0.51, 0.3, 0.91])

Check which numbers (element-wise) from the A array are greater than numbers from the B array and print result to the console as shown below.

Expected result:

[ True False False False]



Solution 1 : 

print(np.greater(A,B))

Solution 2 :
print(A > B)
