Using Numpy create the following array:

array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])

Save this array to a text file named 'array.txt' with two decimal places and then load this file back into another variable. Print this variable to the console.


Solution:

import numpy as np

A = np.arange(12).reshape(-1, 4)
np.savetxt('array.txt', A)

B = np.loadtxt('array.txt')
print(B)
